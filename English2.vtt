00:00.920 --> 00:06.494
Chapter three, step
two, PLD lecture.

00:06.494 --> 00:07.740
>> The program
that we're going

00:07.740 --> 00:08.805
to try to write

00:08.805 --> 00:11.130
for chapter three is

00:11.130 --> 00:13.110
one that asks the
user to enter

00:13.110 --> 00:15.825
a season and a
Fahrenheit temperature.

00:15.825 --> 00:17.640
We're going to continue to

00:17.640 --> 00:19.560
ask them to enter
seasons and

00:19.560 --> 00:21.210
temperatures
until they enter

00:21.210 --> 00:23.624
quit for the season.

00:23.624 --> 00:26.400
>> Here is the
starting code that we

00:26.400 --> 00:29.370
typically see for
our programs.

00:29.370 --> 00:30.930
>> We have a
declaration section,

00:30.930 --> 00:31.755
housekeeping,

00:31.755 --> 00:33.360
while the season is not

00:33.360 --> 00:36.480
some special value call
detailLoop until.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.470
>> And then when
you're done,

00:37.470 --> 00:38.639
call endOfJob.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.260
>> housekeeping, detailLoop
and endOfJob

00:40.260 --> 00:42.220
are all listed below,

00:42.220 --> 00:44.314
waiting for some
code to be added.

00:44.314 --> 00:47.479
>> Notice that our
stop value is quit.

00:47.479 --> 00:49.429
>> It's enclosed
in double quotes.

00:49.429 --> 00:52.850
>> That's how we note
strings in programming.

00:52.850 --> 00:54.170
And the data types for

00:54.170 --> 00:55.400
the first time ever are

00:55.400 --> 00:59.070
going to be string
instead of num
